Regardless of the source of pain, I always strive to channel it in a healthy way. There is no greater pain than a bug that consumes hours of your time. What really motivates me is a challenge, and researching through a vast array of possibilities until I find the most efficient solution is exactly the challenge I enjoy. This approach is evident in how I treat my 3-year-old niece. I always encourage her to challenge herself, and I am there to support her, not to question her. I give her the confidence that she can figure things out on her own, but she knows that if she ever needs help, I will be there to support her. I believe that adults and children have more in common than they imagine, and I am convinced that a great work environment is one that empowers its employees while being there to support them. I can't wait to work in such a place.","I could spend a lot of time discussing my qualifications and what makes me good at what I do you can see that all over my portfolio and my LinkedIn account, but in this section?, I want to focus on why I am great, not just how.","\"Why\" stands for my personal traits, while \"how\" relates to qualifications, projects, and experiences that result from the \"why.\" so </span> why me?</span>."],"button":"why me?"},"contacts":{"title":"Contacts","text":"I’m interested in work/freelance opportunities.
